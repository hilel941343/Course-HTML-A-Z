# 🌐 Basic HTML Course
As part of this project, I completed a Basic HTML Course that introduced the foundational elements of web development using HTML. The course focused on understanding the syntax and structure of HTML and provided hands-on experience in building simple, well-structured web pages.

Key learning outcomes and activities included:

HTML Syntax & Structure: Gained a solid understanding of elements, tags, attributes, and how they are used to build web content.

Page Layout: Created basic page layouts using headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists.

Forms & Inputs: Learned how to build interactive forms with input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and submit buttons.

Best Practices: Followed standards for writing clean and semantic HTML code.
